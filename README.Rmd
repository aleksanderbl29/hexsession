The goal of hexsession is to create tile of hexagonal logos for each loaded package in a session (all packages attached to the search path except for base packages). 

## Installation

You can install the development version of hexsession like so:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes)
remotes::install_github("luisdva/hexsession")
```

## Using hexsession

With hexsession installed, we can create a self-contained HTML file with tiled hex logos for all loaded packages in a session. If a package does not have a logo bundled in `man/figures/` or if the image cannot be found easily, a generic-looking logo with the package name will be generated.


For a given session with libraries loaded in addition to base packages: 

```{r example, eval=FALSE}
library(hexsession)
make_tile()
```

The `make_tile()` function will render the HTML output in a new folder in the working directory using a Quarto template file that will also be copied to this new directory.

For a session with the following packages loaded: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(annotater)
library(ggforce)
library(purrr)
library(forcats)
library(unheadr)
library(sdmTMB)
library(parsnip)
library(DBI)
library(broom)
library(vctrs)
library(patchwork)


hexsession::make_tile()
```

The output would look like this: 
![](man/figures/exampletile.png)

The [hexout_example.html](inst/extdata/hexout_example.html) shows the interactive, responsive HTML version that adapts to the size of the browser window and includes hyperlinks to each package website.

To save a static version of the hex tile, we call `snap_tile()` with a path to the output image and optionally, height and width values to change the viewport size. 


## Notes

This packages depends on working installations of magick, Quarto, and chromote and thus needs a Chromium-based web browser (e.g., Chrome, Chromium, Opera, or Vivaldi) installation.

hexsession is very much work in progress and highly experimental. I am still learning good-practices for packages that create files and directories, use system commands, and launch browser sessions.

All feedback is welcome in any form (issues, pull requests, etc.)

### Credit and LLM disclosure statement

- css and html code for the responsive hex grid comes from [this tutorial](https://css-tricks.com/hexagons-and-beyond-flexible-responsive-grid-patterns-sans-media-queries/) by Temani Afif.

- the javascript code to populate the divs in the Quarto template was written with input from the Claude 3.5 Sonnet LLM running in the Continue extension in the Positron IDE.
